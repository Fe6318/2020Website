            <div class="info">Two rookie teams representing Freedom Middle School competed in their first Wisconsin FIRST LEGO League Appleton Regional Tournament in the 2017 challenge called Hydrodynamics. Both teams were coached by Karla Grunler and Bob Ozzello along with the help of several parents and mentors. Team 31275 I.R.I.S.H. B.O.T.S. competed at the Appleton Regional Tournament in the 2018 challenge, Into Orbit, with five returning members and three rookies under coaches Karla Grunler and Bob Ozzello. The team received the Strategy and Innovation Award and became sectional qualifiers. In the 2019 challenge called City Shaper, team 31275 competed again at regionals under the name LEGO Loungers with one returning member and five rookies led by coaches Karla Grunler and Bob Ozzello. The team received the Project Presentation 2nd Place Award and qualified for sectionals. Over the years, past and present members of Freedom Engineers Team 6318 have mentored the middle school team, including two past members of Freedom LEGO League teams. Team 31275 welcomes new members, parents, and mentors to join them in offseason activities as they look forward to competing in the future.

        <div class="info">The team was started by Mr. Rupiper with help from team 93 and specifically Joe Lambie. The game this year was Steam Works. The season started out a bit slow, but we had several meetings before the season with team building activities and attempted fundraising. One example of this was having a movie night where we showed Star Wars. We definitely had some passionate students in the beginning, but we started out with low numbers for sure.
                As the season started, we picked up momentum with more students joining and helping. We chose a simple design for our gear collection system, essentially just a ramp that slides into a slot and then the gear can be grabbed in the center easily. For our rope climbing system we had a sort of wheel in the center that had Velcro on it and a motor attached. We would drive up to the rope and spin the motor full speed eventually climbing to rope. The motor had a ratchet attached (like a hand tool ratchet) that would keep the bot from slipping down. The build season went smoothly (especially for a rookie team) we even had some extra time to practice and have tryouts for the drive team.
                We attended the Lake Superior regional in Duluth Minnesota. Overall, we competed very well this year thanks to our excellent drive team (Trevor VanWychen as driver and Dakota Schuh as operator) and human players (James Heminger and Nathan Wolfe). We ended up placing 21st of 63 and were selected for playoffs by alliance 5 team captain 4728. We made our way all the way to the semifinals losing to alliance 1 (who would go on to win the finals). Only getting to the semifinals did not qualify us to go to the world's competition, however we won the Rookie all-star award, which did qualify us!
                The world's competition took place in St. Louis Missouri in the former Ram's stadium. This was the last year the competition was help in St. Louis it moved to Detroit the year after. We did well in the event ranking 15th of 68. Although we did not get selected. The competition was very fun and a rewarding experience for everyone who was able to make it. It was amazing to meet so many other teams and see the spirit of FIRST in full force!
